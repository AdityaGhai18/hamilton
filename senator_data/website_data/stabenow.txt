About Debbie Stabenow
“Made in Michigan” through and through, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow continues to lead on public policy and improve the lives of the people of Michigan and Americans across our country. Her leadership is characterized by an unrivaled work ethic, the ability to build bipartisan coalitions to get things done, and a commitment to public service that has set the standard for constituent service.
Throughout her years in public service, she has blazed trails and opened doors for women and girls. Among her many “firsts” – she was the first woman elected to the United States Senate from Michigan.
As the author of two landmark programs that are transforming the health of our Great Lakes, there is no greater champion for our Great Lakes, natural resources, and Michigan way of life.
Senator Stabenow has persistently focused on making things in America and bringing jobs home. Because of her leadership, Michigan is well-positioned as a global leader in the clean energy economy. She knows that we can’t have a strong economy unless we make things and grow things. As Chairwoman of the powerful Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, her work continues to shape our nation’s food and farm policy, impacting generations to come.
Senator Stabenow helped write the Affordable Care Act and has passed major reforms to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Her bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act is transforming the way we deliver high-quality community behavioral health services in America. Because of her leadership, we are now going to be funding health care above the neck the same as health care below the neck.
From child nutrition, to school-based health clinics, to children’s healthcare, Senator Stabenow is also a national leader on children’s health.

Key Issues
Making Quality Health Care Affordable
Senator Stabenow believes that quality healthcare is a basic human right. As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee and Ranking Member of the Health Subcommittee, she has led efforts in Congress to make health care more affordable. More
Environment and Great Lakes
Senator Debbie Stabenow is the Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate Great Lakes Task Force and is one of our greatest champions for protecting our Great Lakes and environment. As someone who has lived in Michigan her whole life, Stabenow understands that our Great Lakes and waterways are vital to our economy and our way of life—supporting more than 800,000 Michigan jobs. More
Standing Up for Our Veterans
U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow believes our veterans should not stand at the back of any line. Whether it’s health care, education, a chance at a good job, or the military recognitions they earned in service, our nation must keep its promises to our heroes who have served. She learned this respect for service from her own family – her father served in World War II. More
New Skills for New Jobs Agenda
As Sen. Stabenow travels the state, she frequently meets with business owners who express a critical need for more skilled workers. She also meets with labor leaders who offer opportunities for training and apprenticeships for good-paying jobs in the skilled trades. And she hears from parents frustrated with the lack of opportunities for their children who are not college-bound as well as educators who are innovating to meet these needs. Last summer, she brought all of these leaders together in communities across the state to discuss how we can partner to meet the needs of employers and provide job opportunities for all Michigan workers and students. Now she is introducing her New Skills for New Jobs Agenda to help every young person get the skills they need for a good-paying job. More
American Jobs Agenda
Senator Stabenow is laser-focused on creating jobs here in America.  Her American Jobs Agenda will ensure we are making products in America, closing loopholes that send jobs overseas, and holding countries like China accountable for unfair trade practices. More
Supporting Michigan’s Agricultural Economy
Senator Debbie Stabenow is a champion for Michigan agriculture and rural communities. As Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, she wrote the bipartisan 2014 Farm Bill, which streamlined more than 100 programs while making historic investments in land and water conservation, local food systems, and specialty crops. As the current Chairwoman of the Committee, she built on that progress by co-authoring the historic 2018 Farm Bill, which passed on a strong bipartisan Senate vote of 87-13 – the most votes in favor of a Farm Bill in history. The bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill strengthens Michigan’s agricultural economy, which is the state’s second-largest industry, supporting one in four jobs. The bill also has a major impact in protecting Michigan’s Great Lakes, investing in our small towns and rural communities, promoting Michigan forestry, growing local food economies, and providing healthy food for families.
